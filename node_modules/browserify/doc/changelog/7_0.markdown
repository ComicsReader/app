Global transforms are now resolved to an absolute path before walking files.
This fixes some bugs with local module versions taking precedence over global
transforms and unresolvable global transforms spanning system directories.

This is a small breaking change since now transform objects live in the pipeline
between the record and deps phases. This should only affect programs that expect
records in the pipeline to only contain file objects.
