Version 6 is a tiny but breaking change to how source map paths work.

Now all source map paths are relative by default. This makes it easier to have
deterministic debug builds across different systems and directories. If
browserify is installed in a project-local directory, all the source map paths
will be self-contained and relative against that location in node_modules.
