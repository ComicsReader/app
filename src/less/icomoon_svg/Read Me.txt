The *SVG* folder contains the icons you selected as separate SVG files.

If you prefer using PNGs, PDFs, or CSS sprites, refer to the Preferences panel of the IcoMoon app before downloading your zip pack.

The *demo.html* lists the icons that you selected. To insert your icons as inline SVGs (with the <use> element), copy the <svg> element (that contains symbol definitions) from the source of the demo.html file, below your own HTML's <body> tag. After copying this SVG, you can reference your glyphs like the following:

<svg class="icon icon-price-tag"><use xlink:href="#icon-price-tag"></use></svg>

You can get this code from the SVG tab of the IcoMoon app, or refer to the source of the demo.html file. To see how you can change the color/size of your icons using CSS, refer to the example provided in the *style.css* file.
If you prefer to reference an external SVG (containing <defs>) instead of embedding it in HTML, you will need to use javascript to fetch the SVG in order to make sure your SVGs will work fine in IE. IcoMoon's Quick Usage mode can take care of that and host your SVGs too.

You may ignore the *svgdefs.svg* file. It contains the same SVG definitions as the ones you can find in the demo.html file.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu > Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
